## Installation:
Open command prompt or whatever, and copy&paste the following command:
```
cd .spicetify\Themes && git clone https://github.com/ccrashtek/Dribbble-Pinky
```
after that, you need to install dribbblish extension:

### Windows
In Powershell:
```powershell
cd "$(spicetify -c | Split-Path)\Themes\Dribbble-Pinky"
Copy-Item dribbblish.js ..\..\Extensions
spicetify config extensions dribbblish.js
spicetify config current_theme Dribbble-Pinky color_scheme base
spicetify config inject_css 1 replace_colors 1 overwrite_assets 1
spicetify apply
```

### Linux and MacOS:
In Bash:
```bash
cd "$(dirname "$(spicetify -c)")/Themes/Dribbble-Pinky"
cp dribbblish.js ../../Extensions
spicetify config extensions dribbblish.js
spicetify config current_theme Dribbble-Pinky color_scheme base
spicetify config inject_css 1 replace_colors 1 overwrite_assets 1
spicetify apply
```

I recommend you to use a ```SpotifyNoControl``` app, you can apply icon by creating shortcut and going to shortcut properties

## Customization:
You can simply customize your color_cheme by changing colors in ```color.ini``` file.
Default theme is white, you can change it do dark by typing the following command:
```
spicetify config color_scheme dark
```
and to change it back to white:
```
spicetify config color_scheme white
```

### Happy new year @everyone!
